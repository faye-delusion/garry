## what is garry

garry is backbone of weedblazers. without garry weedblazers is nothing. garry does it all. we love you garry.

*please note garry is designed specifically around weedblazers itself and there is a good chance you will need to change a lot of shit for the code to work in other servers.*

## how to use:

- pull repo
- run setup.py

### When running setup.py

- it will ask you for your token, check the code if that unsettles you (scary token oooo)
- if you fuck anything up during the config setup (wrong token, invalid id for log channel, etc) go into your config.json file

it should look something like this
```json
{

  "token": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz",
  "prefix": "g2",
  "log_channel": 1234567890

}
```

if the bot does not run at all, check `token`. paste in the new one if you generate one (failed english twice bear with me)

if it runs but nothing logs check `log_channel` and replace if necessary
