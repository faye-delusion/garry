## what is garry

garry is backbone of weedblazers. without garry weedblazers is nothing. garry does it all. we love you garry.

*please note garry is designed specifically around weedblazers itself and there is a good chance you will need to change a lot of shit for the code to work in other servers.*

## how to use:

- pull repo
- create new file config.json
- add the following to config.json

```json
{

  "token": "TOKEN",
  "prefix": "!",
  "logchannel": 1234567890

}
```
replace `TOKEN` with your bot token, change the `prefix` to whatever the fuck you want and change `logchannel` to the id of the channel where you want bot logs
* i will change this to auto generate a config file soon (maybe)
